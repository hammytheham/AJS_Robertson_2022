# AJS_Robertson_2022
Repository containing links and code snippets for Robertson and others (2022)

This repository contains links and code snippets for Robertson and others (2022). The data structure is as follows

1) R-CODE - In this folder are a collection of the statistical model results and codes. 

2) Full archive - This section contains an archive of thick amount of poorly commented, structureless code that works but is somewhat embarrasing. This contains most of the workflows.

3) Links for Geothermal/Geochemical modelling - The new geothermal model has been further developed into a more user friendly product. Specifically data can be generated online at www.co2-gasp.com and the code repository for this web-app is located at https://github.com/hammytheham/CO2_GASP_PROGRAM . The webapp also models CO2 interaction with the USGS water chemistry database.
